# Sitting figure instructions (seated/chibi pose)

These steps are written to match the **seated keychain look** (bent legs, feet forward) while keeping the workflow constraint that **pants should be put on before you fully lock in the pose**.

Applies to both Standard + Keychain mini; the *sequence* matters more than the size.

## What makes the “sitting” silhouette

You need three things at the same time:
1. **Hip angle**: legs attach low and forward, not straight down.
2. **Knee bend illusion**: either a real bend (joint/armature) or a sculpted “crease”.
3. **Feet presented forward**: feet slightly in front of the torso, and close together.

## Tools / notions (recommended)

- Stitch markers, pins
- Yarn needle + strong sewing thread (optional but very helpful for sculpting)
- A little extra fiberfill
- Optional: thin craft wire / pipe cleaner (ONLY if this is not for a child and you can secure ends safely)

## Critical workflow rule (pants first)

If your pants are a separate garment (not crocheted as part of the legs), you must **dress the doll early**:
- Put pants on **before** the torso is fully stuffed and before the head/arms are permanently attached.
- If legs/feet are already attached and too large to pass through the waistband, you’ll be blocked.

## Two build paths (choose what matches your patterns)

### Path A (recommended): Pants as garment over separate legs
Use this if you have (or will add) separate **skin-tone legs/feet** and the pants are only clothing.

### Path B (workable fallback): Pants legs become the legs
Use this if you do *not* have a separate leg pattern yet. You will lightly stuff the pants legs even though `patterns/pants.md` says “not stuffed”.
This is acceptable for a keychain display piece; just keep stuffing minimal so it still reads as “pants”.

## Path A — Detailed steps (pants as garment)

### 1) Prep: stop at “test-fit checkpoints”
Crochet:
- Torso from `patterns/body.md`, but **do not close it yet** (stop while it’s still open enough to adjust stuffing).
- Pants from `patterns/pants.md`.

Checkpoints to pause at:
- Pants: finish waistband, weave in ends, leave it as a soft garment.
- Torso: stop before final closing decreases (or temporarily do them but don’t cinch shut), because you’ll want to shape the lower torso/hips.

### 2) Dress the doll early
1. Put pants on **before** final torso stuffing/closing.
2. Slide pants up to where the waistband will sit (usually the torso’s widest point).
3. Use 4 pins to anchor waistband at front/back/left/right so it can’t rotate while you pose legs.

Tip: if the waistband is slightly loose, don’t tighten it yet—posing can change how snug it needs to be.

### 3) Create the seated hip angle (leg placement)
Goal: legs point **forward** with the knees “up” and the feet in front.

1. Mark the torso underside into 4 points: front center, back center, left, right.
2. Decide where each leg attaches:
   - For a seated/chibi look, the leg attachment points sit **slightly forward of the side points** (closer to the front).
3. Pin both legs in place:
   - Thighs angled forward.
   - Knees aligned evenly.
   - Feet close together (touching or nearly touching).

### 4) Lock the pose before final stuffing
This is the key to “it stays sitting”.

1. With legs pinned, do **tack stitches**:
   - Sew each leg to torso with 6–10 strong whip stitches (enough to hold, not final).
2. Add **pose-lock seams**:
   - Sew a short seam between the two legs at the inner thighs (2–4 stitches).
   - Sew a short seam between the knees (2–3 stitches).
   - (Optional) Sew the ankles together (2–3 stitches) if you want the feet neatly paired.

These seams stop the legs from splaying and keep the “knees together” look like the reference.

### 5) Sculpt the knee bend (no armature needed)
Even if the leg is a straight tube, you can create a visual bend:

1. Identify the “knee line” on each leg (about halfway between hip and ankle for chibi).
2. Run a strong thread through the leg at the knee line:
   - Enter at the inner knee, exit at the outer knee (or front-to-back).
3. Pull gently to create a crease, then knot securely.
4. Repeat once more (a second pass) if the crease relaxes.

Tip: under-stuffing the knee area helps the crease hold.

### 6) Final stuffing + butt/seat shaping
To make the doll actually “sit” (not topple):

1. Add a little extra stuffing toward the **back lower torso** to form a seat.
2. Keep the **front lower torso** slightly flatter.
3. Sit the doll on the table:
   - If it tips backward: add stuffing to the lower front torso.
   - If it tips forward: add stuffing to the lower back torso (or shift legs slightly forward).

### 7) Fix waistband permanently (after pose is stable)
1. With the doll sitting correctly, sew the waistband to the torso at:
   - front center, back center, left, right (minimum)
2. If you want a cleaner fit, add a few more stitches evenly around.

### 8) Finish closing the torso
Once the seated pose + pants placement is correct:
- Complete the remaining decreases/closing on the torso (or close the opening with a drawstring seam).

## Path B — Detailed steps (pants legs are the legs)

This creates a “one-piece” lower body that sits well, and you can still dress/shape early.

### 1) Crochet pants through the join/waist
Follow `patterns/pants.md` and complete the pants.

### 2) Lightly stuff the pants legs
1. Add small amounts of stuffing into each leg.
2. Keep the knees slightly under-stuffed so they can crease.

### 3) Make the seated bend
Use either (or both):
- **Thread-sculpt knee crease** (same method as Path A)
- **Sew-in bend**: fold the leg at the knee and stitch a few stitches through both layers to hold the fold

### 4) Attach to torso (forward-tilted)
Sew the pants waistband (or upper pants body) to the torso so that the legs angle forward.
Then add the same **pose-lock seams** (inner thighs + knees) to keep them together.

## Quick “looks like the reference” checklist

- Knees are close together and slightly higher than the feet
- Feet point forward and are close together
- Torso sits slightly behind the knees (a relaxed slump)
- Pants are attached/anchored so they don’t rotate when handled

- Pants pattern: `patterns/pants.md`
- Torso pattern: `patterns/body.md`
- Count review/validation: `patterns/COUNT_REVIEW.md`
