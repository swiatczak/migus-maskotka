# Pattern: Hair (Cap + Layered Locks)

## Notes
- Work hair cap in rounds to fit head.
- Locks are attached as slip-stitch loops or sewn strands.
- Keep direction consistent (right-to-left sweep for crown).

## Hair cap (Standard)

| Rnd | Instruction | Sts |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | MR 6 | 6 |
| 2 | inc x6 | 12 |
| 3 | (sc, inc) x6 | 18 |
| 4 | (2sc, inc) x6 | 24 |
| 5 | (3sc, inc) x6 | 30 |
| 6–7 | sc around | 30 |

Fasten off with a tail for positioning.

## Hair cap (Keychain mini)

| Rnd | Instruction | Sts |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | MR 6 | 6 |
| 2 | inc x6 | 12 |
| 3 | (sc, inc) x6 | 18 |
| 4 | (2sc, inc) x6 | 24 |
| 5–6 | sc around | 24 |

## Lock lengths (A/B/C)
Define 3 consistent lock lengths:
- A = short (e.g., ch 6 loop)
- B = medium (e.g., ch 8 loop)
- C = long (e.g., ch 10 loop)

Adjust chain count by your yarn/hook to match the reference silhouette.

## Attachment zones (Standard 30-st cap)
Locks are attached in **layers** to different rounds so the counts stay consistent and the hair looks fuller.

Before attaching locks:
1. Put the cap on the head and pin it in place.
2. Choose your **front center** (above the nose/eyes).
3. On the last round of the cap, count stitches to mark a **front 18‑st span** for the fringe.

### Layer map (Standard)
- **Layer A (edge / fringe + edge filler):** attach into **Rnd 7** (30 sts total)
- **Layer B (crown sweep):** attach into **Rnd 6** (place 24 locks)
- **Layer C (top/back fill):** attach into **Rnd 5** (place 16 locks)

### Layer A — Edge (Rnd 7, 30 sts total)
Attach **one lock per stitch** around the edge: **18 fringe + 12 edge filler = 30**.

Lock method (loop lock):
- sl st into stitch
- ch A/B/C (per the sequence)
- sl st back into the same stitch to form a loop

#### A1) Fringe (18 sts)
Work across the marked front 18 stitches.
Suggested sequence (18):
- C, C, B, B, C, B, B, C, C, B, B, C, B, B, C, C, B, B

#### A2) Side + nape edging (12 sts total)
Work the remaining 12 edge stitches (the back half).
Suggested distribution (12):
- Right side: 3×A
- Nape: 6×A (swap the 1st + last nape locks to **B** if you want more bulk at the corners)
- Left side: 3×A

### Layer B — Crown sweep (Rnd 6, 24 locks)
Attach loops so they overlap like shingles, sweeping right → left.

Placement:
- Skip the **front 6 stitches** of Rnd 6 (to avoid a bulky “bowl cut” over the fringe).
- Attach locks into the **next 24 stitches** around (24 placements).

Suggested sequence (24): mostly B with some C:
- B, B, C, B, B, B, C, B, B, B, C, B, B, B, C, B, B, B, C, B, B, B, B, C

### Layer C — Top/back fill (Rnd 5, 16 locks)
Optional but recommended for the “shaggy” look.

Placement:
- Attach **16 locks** into Rnd 5, spaced roughly evenly over the top/back (not the very front).

Suggested mix:
- 12×A + 4×B (use more B if you want a fuller crown)

## Keychain mini notes (24-st cap)
Use the same layering idea, scaled down:
- **Layer A (edge / Rnd 6):** 24 locks total = **fringe 14 + edge filler 10**
- **Layer B (Rnd 5):** 18 locks (skip the front 4 sts)
- **Layer C (Rnd 4):** 12 locks (top/back only, optional)

Mini edge distribution example (Rnd 6):
- Fringe: 14 (use B/C)
- Remaining 10: Right 2×A, Nape 6×A (swap corners to B), Left 2×A
