# Pattern: Hair (Cap + Layered Locks)

## Notes
- Work hair cap in rounds to fit head.
- Locks are attached as slip-stitch loops or sewn strands.
- Keep direction consistent (right-to-left sweep for crown).

## Hair cap (Standard)

| Rnd | Instruction | Sts |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | MR 6 | 6 |
| 2 | inc x6 | 12 |
| 3 | (sc, inc) x6 | 18 |
| 4 | (2sc, inc) x6 | 24 |
| 5 | (3sc, inc) x6 | 30 |
| 6–7 | sc around | 30 |

Fasten off with a tail for positioning.

## Hair cap (Keychain mini)

| Rnd | Instruction | Sts |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | MR 6 | 6 |
| 2 | inc x6 | 12 |
| 3 | (sc, inc) x6 | 18 |
| 4 | (2sc, inc) x6 | 24 |
| 5–6 | sc around | 24 |

## Lock lengths (A/B/C)
Define 3 consistent lock lengths:
- A = short (e.g., ch 6 loop)
- B = medium (e.g., ch 8 loop)
- C = long (e.g., ch 10 loop)

Adjust chain count by your yarn/hook to match the reference silhouette.

## Attachment zones (Standard 30-st cap)
We split the edge into zones:
- **Fringe:** front 18 sts
- **Crown layer 1 band:** next 24 sts behind fringe (overlapping placement, attach into R5/R6)
- **Crown layer 2 fill:** back/top fill, attach into R6/R7

### Fringe (18 sts)
Attach yarn at front-left of the fringe zone.
For each of 18 stitches: sl st into stitch, ch B/C, sl st back into same stitch (loop).
Suggested sequence (18):
- C, C, B, B, C, B, B, C, C, B, B, C, B, B, C, C, B, B

### Crown layer 1 (24 sts, swept right→left)
Attach loops so they overlap like shingles.
Suggested sequence (24): mostly B with some C:
- B, B, C, B, B, B, C, B, B, B, C, B, B, B, C, B, B, B, C, B, B, B, B, C

### Crown layer 2 (back fill, 30 sts placement area)
Attach shorter A/B loops near nape; keep density moderate:
- 20×A + 10×B distributed evenly

## Side + nape edging
Along lower edge excluding fringe:
- Right side: 8 sts → A
- Nape: 14 sts → A (place 2×B near corners)
- Left side: 8 sts → A
