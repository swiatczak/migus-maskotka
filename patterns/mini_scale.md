# Pattern Notes: Mini / Keychain Scale

All parts use the same structure as Standard, scaled down.

## Baseline
- Hook: 2.0 mm
- Keep stitch tension tight for firm shaping.

## Target stitch counts (mini)
- Head max: 36 sts
- Torso max: 18 sts (aligned with `patterns/body.md`)
- Limbs: reduce straight rounds by at least 1 round from Standard.

## Integration checks
- Keep mini pants join/waist compatible with mini torso widest count.
- Prefer 18-st joins for torso/pants compatibility in this repo set.
