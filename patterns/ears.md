# Pattern: Ears (make 2)

## Notes
- Ears are worked in continuous rounds, then folded slightly when sewn for natural shape.
- Leave a tail at least 20 cm for sewing.
- Place ears after eyes are set and before hair placement is finalized.

## Standard ears (2.5 mm, DK)

|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | MR 4 | 4 |
| 2 | inc x4 | 8 |
| 3 | (sc, inc) x4 | 12 |
| 4 | sc around | 12 |

Fasten off. Do not stuff.

### Placement (Standard head = 42-st widest rounds)
- Sew ears between rounds 9 and 12 of the head.
- Align each ear over a 4-st span.
- Keep approximately 14 stitches between ear centers when viewed from the front.

## Keychain mini ears (2.0 mm)

| Rnd | Instruction | Sts |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | MR 4 | 4 |

## Sewing tip
Before stitching permanently:
1. Pin both ears.
2. Check symmetry from front and top view.
3. Use a whip stitch through ear edge loops and head front loops for a clean, flat join.
