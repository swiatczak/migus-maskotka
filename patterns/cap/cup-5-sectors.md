# Baseball Cap Cup — 5 Vertical Color Sectors

## Goal
Create a cap crown (“cup”) with 5 vertical sectors in this order around the head:
1) White (front center)
2) Red
3) Blue
4) White
5) Red

## Notation
- MR = magic ring
- sc = single crochet
- inc = increase (2 sc in one stitch)
- sl st = slip stitch
- ch = chain
- FO = fasten off
Work tight amigurumi tension.

## Crown Top (increase to divisible-by-5 stitch count)
Work in continuous spiral until stated otherwise. Use WHITE for the top to keep the front panel clean.

| Round | Instruction | Stitch Count |
|------:|-------------|--------------|
| R1 | 6 sc in MR | 6 |
| R2 | inc x6 | 12 |
| R3 | (sc, inc) x6 | 18 |
| R4 | (2 sc, inc) x6 | 24 |
| R5 | (3 sc, inc) x6 | 30 |
| R6 | (4 sc, inc) x6 | 36 |
| R7 | (5 sc, inc) x4, then 12 sc | 40 |

Notes:
- In R7, distribute the 4 increases roughly evenly across the round to avoid bumps.
- Place a stitch marker at the start of the round.
- After R7 you have 40 sts, which divides into 5 equal sectors.

## Sector Map (40 sts total)
Each sector is 8 stitches.

| Stitch Range | Color | Sector Role |
|------------:|-------|-------------|
| 1–8 | White | FRONT CENTER |
| 9–16 | Red | Side panel |
| 17–24 | Blue | Back/side panel |
| 25–32 | White | Side panel |
| 33–40 | Red | Side/back panel |

IMPORTANT:
- Stitch 1 is the front center. Keep your marker at stitch 1 each round so the white front stays centered.

## Color Changes (clean sector edges)
Use “last yarn-over with new color” method:
- On the final step of the last stitch of the old color, yarn over with the NEW color and pull through to complete that stitch.
- Continue with the new color in the next stitch.

Anti-hole tip:
- Pull the first stitch of each new color slightly snug and twist yarns once at the back.

## Crown Body (build height with vertical sectors)
Maintain the sector map every round (8 sts per color block).

| Round | Instruction | Stitch Count |
|------:|-------------|--------------|
| R8–R14 | 40 sc total, keeping the 5 sectors aligned | 40 |

## Optional Taper (more “real cap” shape)
If you want a slight inward curve near the bottom edge:

| Round | Instruction | Stitch Count |
|------:|-------------|--------------|
| R15 | (6 sc, dec) x5 | 35 |

After taper, each sector becomes 7 stitches:
- White 1–7, Red 8–14, Blue 15–21, White 22–28, Red 29–35

Then work 1–2 rounds even:
- R16–R17: 35 sc, maintaining 7-st sectors.

## Finish Edge
Choose one:

### Option A: Spiral finish (simple)
- sl st in next stitch, FO.
- Weave ends down inside matching-color sectors.

### Option B: Joined rounds (best alignment)
If you prefer perfectly vertical panel edges with no spiral drift:
- End each round with sl st to first stitch, ch 1, then start next round in the same stitch.
(Do this starting from R8 if chosen.)

## Assembly Orientation
- The White 1–8 sector must align with the brim midpoint and face front.
- Use the round-start marker as the front reference throughout.
