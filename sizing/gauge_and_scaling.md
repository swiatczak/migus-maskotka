# Gauge, Sizing & Scaling

## Measure your gauge
Make a small swatch in **continuous rounds** (amigurumi style), 20–24 sts per round for 6–8 rounds.
Flatten gently (don’t stretch). Measure:

- **Stitch gauge**: stitches per 10 cm (or per 1 cm)
- **Row/round gauge**: rounds per 10 cm (or per 1 cm)

Write down:
- S = stitches per cm
- R = rounds per cm

Example:
- 24 sts in 10 cm → S = 2.4 sts/cm
- 28 rounds in 10 cm → R = 2.8 rnds/cm

## Target sizes in this project
This pattern is drafted for two variants:

| Variant | Target doll height | Hook | Yarn | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Standard | 10–13 cm | 2.5 mm | DK cotton | primary mascot |
| Keychain mini | ~7–9 cm | 2.0 mm | DK cotton or sport | add keyring loop |

> Height depends on body proportions, stuffing firmness, and gauge. Use the scaling formulas below to tune.

## Scaling math (practical)
### 1) Circumference / width scaling (stitches)
If you want a part to be wider/narrower, scale stitch counts by the ratio of target to current size.

Let:
- C_current = current circumference/width (cm)
- C_target = desired circumference/width (cm)
- S = your stitches per cm

Then target stitch count:
- **Sts_target ≈ round(C_target × S)**

If you don’t know circumference but you know you want **a percentage change**:
- **Sts_target ≈ round(Sts_current × (C_target / C_current))**

### 2) Height scaling (rounds)
Let:
- H_current = current height (cm)
- H_target = desired height (cm)
- R = your rounds per cm

Then target rounds:
- **Rnd_target ≈ round(H_target × R)**

### 3) Scaling by overall doll height (fast method)
If your finished Standard doll comes out at H_done, and you want H_target:

Scale factor:
- **k = H_target / H_done**

Then:
- **Sts_target ≈ round(Sts_current × k)**
- **Rnd_target ≈ round(Rnd_current × k)**

Because amigurumi is 3D, this is an approximation; fit-check around the doll.

## Size tables for key parts (baseline)
These are **draft values** for Standard (2.5 mm, DK). Use scaling math to adjust.

### Head / Cap circumference (approx.)
| Variant | Typical head circumference | Cap round count at 30 sts | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Standard | 12–14 cm | 4 rounds even after 30 sts | snug fit |
| Keychain mini | 9–11 cm | 2–3 rounds even after 24–27 sts | reduce one increase round |

### Waist circumference (pants)
| Variant | Typical waist circumference | Join-round stitch count | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Standard | 10–12 cm | 24 sts | ease built-in |
| Keychain mini | 8–10 cm | 18–21 sts | scale legs and join |

### Brim width (cap)
| Variant | Brim width (front) | Brim rows | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Standard | 3.5–4.5 cm | 3 rows | centered on front 10 sts |
| Keychain mini | 2.5–3.5 cm | 2–3 rows | reduce each row by 1–2 sts |
